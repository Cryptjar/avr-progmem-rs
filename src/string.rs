//! String utilities
//!
//! This module offers further utilities base on [`ProgMem`] to make working
//! with strings in progmem more convenient.
//!
//! The difficulty with strings is that normally they are either heap allocated
//! (as with the std Rust `String`) or dynamically sized (as with `str`).
//! To store a string in progmem, one needs first of all a fixed-sized storage
//! variant of a `str`.
//! One option is to use byte string literals (e.g. `b"foobar"`), however,
//! for some reason those only accept ASCII and no Unicode.
//! At some day, one might be able to to convert arbitrary string literals to
//! byte arrays like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! # use std::convert::TryInto;
//! // Dose not compile as of 1.51, because `try_into` is not a const fn, yet
//! static WIKIPEDIA: [u8; 12] = "维基百科".as_bytes().try_into().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! However, for the time being, this module offers as a convenient workaround:
//! * [`LoadedString`] a simple UTF-8 encoded sized byte array
//! * [`PmString`] a UTF-8 encoded sized byte array in progmem similar to [`ProgMem`].
//!
//!
//! # Working with Strings
//!
//! To work with strings in progmem, this crate offers two APIs and two modes
//! of operation, each with their own little tradeoff.
//!
//! ## Operation Modes
//!
//! When you want to use strings from progmem you have two options:
//!
//! * you can load them as whole from progmem into RAM and work with them
//!   essentially like stack-allocated `&str`s
//! * or, you choose to load the strings `char` after `char` from progmem and work
//!   with them using a `char`-iterator.
//!
//! The first mode of operation obviously allows you to use them everywhere,
//! where you can use a `&str`, giving you high compatibility with other APIs.
//! On the other hand, this comes at the cost of high RAM usage.
//! So you must leave enough free RAM to fit all your string, thus the bigger,
//! your biggest string is, the less RAM you must use statically.
//! So, you might have to split your strings somehow to make them manageable.
//!
//! The alternative is to only load just one `char` at a time.
//! This obviously limits the amount of RAM that you need, independently of
//! how big your strings are, allowing you to work with really huge strings.
//! However, you no longer get a `&str`, any you have make do with a `char`
//! iterator.
//!
//! However, if you only need your strings to be printed in some way,
//! the [`Display`](fmt::Display) and [`ufmt::uDisplay`] traits implementations
//! (the latter only if the `ufmt` crate feature is enabled) of [`PmString`],
//! might become very handy.
//! These trait implementations only need the `char`-iterator so they are very
//! economic with respect to RAM usage.
//!
//! ## APIs
//!
//! API-wise you can either:
//!
//! * define progmem `static`s via the [`progmem`](crate::progmem) macro
//!   and use them all over your program,
//! * or, you create single-use progmem strings via the
//!   [`progmem_str`](crate::progmem_str) and
//!   [`progmem_display`](crate::progmem_display) macro
//!
//! The single-use macros are the most concise option, but also a rather
//! special-case solution.
//! `progmem_str` gives you are very temporary `&str` to an ad-hoc loaded
//! progmem string, so you can only pass it to a function call and you need
//! enough RAM to store it.
//! On the other hand, [`progmem_display`](crate::progmem_display) gives you
//! just something that is `impl Display + uDisplay`, so you can just print it,
//! but it has minimal RAM usage.
//!
//! If need anything more flexible or fancy, you are probably best served
//! creating a `static` via [`progmem`](crate::progmem) macro.
//!
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Using [`PmString`] directly via the [`progmem`] macro:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #![feature(const_option)]
//!
//! # use std::iter::FromIterator;
//! use avr_progmem::progmem;
//! use avr_progmem::string::LoadedString;
//!
//! progmem! {
//!     // A simple Unicode string in progmem, internally stored as fix-sized
//!     // byte array, i.e. a `PmString<18>`.
//!     static progmem string TEXT = "Hello 大賢者";
//!     // text too large to fit in the RAM of a microcontroller
//!     static progmem string LOVECRAFT = include_str!("../examples/test_text.txt");
//! }
//!
//! // You can load it all at once (like a `ProgMem`)
//! let buffer: LoadedString<15> = TEXT.load();
//! // and use that as `&str`
//! assert_eq!("Hello 大賢者", &*buffer);
//!
//! // Or you load it one char at a time (limits RAM usage) via the
//! // chars-iterator
//! let chars_iter = TEXT.chars(); // impl Iterator<Item=char>
//! let exp = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', '大', '賢', '者'];
//! assert_eq!(&exp, &*Vec::from_iter(chars_iter));
//!
//! // Or you use directly the `Display`/`uDisplay` impl on `PmString`
//! // which uses the chars-iterator internally
//! use ufmt::uWrite;
//! #
//! # struct MyWriter;
//! # impl uWrite for MyWriter {
//! #     type Error = ();
//! #     fn write_str(&mut self, _s: &str) -> Result<(),()> {
//! #         Ok(()) // ignore input
//! #     }
//! # }
//! let mut writer =
//! #   MyWriter
//!     /* SNIP */;
//! #[cfg(feature = "ufmt")] // requires the `ufmt` crate feature
//! ufmt::uwrite!(&mut writer, "{}", TEXT);
//! ```
//!
//! Using the special literal in-line string macros [`progmem_str`] and
//! [`progmem_display`]:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #![feature(const_option)]
//!
//! use avr_progmem::progmem_str as F;
//! use avr_progmem::progmem_display as D;
//!
//! // Or you use directly the `Display`/`uDisplay` impl on `PmString`
//! // which uses the chars-iterator internally
//! use ufmt::uWrite;
//! # struct MyWriter;
//! # impl uWrite for MyWriter {
//! #     type Error = ();
//! #     fn write_str(&mut self, _s: &str) -> Result<(),()> {
//! #         Ok(()) // ignore input
//! #     }
//! # }
//! let mut writer =
//! #   MyWriter
//!     /* SNIP */;
//!
//! // In-line string as temporary `&str`
//! writer.write_str(F!("Hello 大賢者"));
//!
//! // In-line string as some `impl Display + uDisplay`
//! #[cfg(feature = "ufmt")] // requires the `ufmt` crate feature
//! ufmt::uwrite!(&mut writer, "{}", D!("Hello 大賢者"));
//! ```
